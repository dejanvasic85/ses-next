Karl, always kept me posted with outcomes, and with processes.

As soon as the job commenced, Karl and his team went above and beyond and we could not have been happier with the final outcome.\n\nIf you are after an electrician that will listen to your needs and then deliver a cost effective solution, look no further than Karl and his team at Storm Electrical. I couldn't recommend Karl and his crew enough.",

He also clearly mentioned the installation process and how much time it will take from ordering to installation.\nHe was also quick to setup installation as soon as the systems were received. For the installation David showed up right on time early in the morning and did a fantastic job. It was quite a complicated installation, for which he put in extra time without rushing and made it work and look immaculate.\nDuring this time David also installed a TV. Due to the placement of beams within the walls it seemed very tedious to hide the cable so we left it out. David came back another day saying he was feeling bad that cable was ruining the look of the TV and he had found a way to get the cable into the wall.\nHe did it by drilling throug 2 beams and hid it inside the wall. They will be my go to electricians for any electrical work. Loved the job and attention to detail.",
