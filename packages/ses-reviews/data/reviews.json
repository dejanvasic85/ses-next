And to complicate matters further, we had some fairly stringent requirements we needed to be met for the\ninstall.\n\nFrom the initial visit and quote, Karl listened to our requirements and then took his time exploring and then explaining to us all possibilities and options available. As soon as the job commenced, Karl and his team went above and beyond and we could not have been happier with the final outcome.\n\nIf you are after an electrician that will listen to your needs and then deliver a cost effective solution, look no further than Karl and his team at Storm Electrical. I couldn't recommend Karl and his crew enough.",

Got us out of a tight spot in the after hours of the day. 10/10 will use him again!",
